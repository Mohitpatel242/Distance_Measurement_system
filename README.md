# Distance_Measurement_system
System for measuring distance with an Arduino Uno 
Using an ultrasonic range finder sensor and an Arduino Uno for power and programming, I created a system for measuring distance using the Arduino IDE. This creative solution not only provides accurate measurements of distance but also highlights my hardware integration and coding abilities.
